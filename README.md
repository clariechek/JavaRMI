# JavaRMI
A calculator application that uses Java RMI to implement server and client sides, and JUnit Jupiter framework for automated testing.
The server contains a map that links each client's ID to their respective stack.
The methods include:
1. `void pushValue(int val, int clientID);`: adds integer `val` to the client's (with `clientID`) stack.
2. `void pushOperation(String operator, int clientID);`: computes the desired operation `operator` on the client's stack values. 
  - This will remove all values on the client stack and push the result of the operation onto the stack. 
  - The operations are `min`, `max`, `lcm`, and `gcd`. 
  - To perform an operation, the client stack must have at least 2 values. Otherwise an error message is returned.
  - Operators `lcm` and `gcd` assume all values as absolute values.
  - Operator `lcm` does not work for value 0.
3. `int pop(int clientID);`: Returns the top-most value on the client's stack.
4. `boolean isEmpty(int clientID);`: Returns true if the client stack is empty.
5. `int delayPop(int millis, int clientID);`: Waits `millis` milliseconds before returning the top-most value on the client's stack.

## Compilation
1. In the project folder run the instruction below. This will compile the files and create the corresponding `.class` files in the `bin` folder.
```
make
```

2. Navigate to the `bin` folder using the below command. This is where we will start the Java RMI Registry, start the server, and run the client.
```
cd bin
```

## Run the Application
1. In the `bin` directory, run the instruction below to start Java RMI Registry (for Solaris(tm) Operating System)
```
rmiregistry &
```
or if you're using Windows, run this:
```
start rmiregistry 
```
The default port the registry runs on is 1099.

2. Next, start the server using the following command (for Solaris(tm) Operating System)
```
java -classpath ./ CalculatorServer &
```
or for Windows, run this:
```
start java -classpath ./ CalculatorServer
```
The output should be the following:
```
Server ready
```

3. Finally, run the client using the command below. To run multiple clients parallelly, run the command below in each terminal for each client. 
```
java  -classpath ./ CalculatorClient
```

## Testing
### Testing Requirements
1. The test script is located in the `tests` folder. To run the tests in Visual Studio Code, you will need:
- JDK (version 1.8 or later)
- Visual Studio Code (version 1.59.0 or later)
- [Visual Studio Code Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

2. Follow the 'Get Started with Java Development' instructions on Visual Studio Code by clicking the `Install JDK` button (on the left of the screenshot below) and blue `Download` button (on the right of the screenshot below).
